## Project: Graph-Based Recommendation Systems for Heterogeneous Networks: marketplace reviews, entertainment industry data and banking products

### Overview:
This repository serves as a central hub for storing and representing key information related to the development project focused on graph-based recommendation systems. The project encompasses diverse data from marketplace reviews, entertainment industry sources, and banking products. It is undertaken as part of the coursework for the "Structural Analysis and Visualization of Networks" at HSE University.

### Purpose 
This project aims to develop graph-based recommender systems, specifically focusing on link prediction with associated probabilities within heterogeneous graphs. Leveraging tools such as PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric alongside sklearn and NetworkX libraries, we intend to explore advanced methodologies for recommendation systems. By using graph neural networks (GNNs), we aim to improve link prediction tasks, ultimately leading to more personalized and effective recommendations.
